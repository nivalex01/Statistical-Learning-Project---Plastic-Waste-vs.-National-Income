# Plastic Waste vs. National-Income
This project analyzes the relationship between national income levels and mismanaged plastic waste per capita across over 150 countries. 
Using non-parametric statistical tests (Shapiro-Wilk, Kruskal-Wallis, and Mann–Whitney U), the study identifies significant differences in plastic waste generation among income groups.
The analysis is based on real-world data from the World Bank and Our World in Data, with implications for global waste policy and environmental planning.


# Plastic Waste vs. National Income

This research project investigates whether national income levels are associated with the amount of mismanaged plastic waste per capita.

## 📊 Data Sources

- [World Bank](https://data.worldbank.org/) – Country income classifications
- [Our World in Data](https://ourworldindata.org/) – Mismanaged plastic waste data

## 📁 Files

- `data/` – CSV files used for analysis
- `analysis/statistical_analysis.ipynb` – Full Jupyter notebook with statistical tests
- `analysis/plots/` – Visualizations (QQ-plot, BoxPlot, etc.)

## 🧪 Methods Used

- Shapiro-Wilk Test for normality
- Kruskal-Wallis Test (non-parametric ANOVA)
- Mann–Whitney U Test for pairwise comparisons

## 📈 Key Findings

- Significant differences in plastic waste generation across income levels.
- High-income countries generate less mismanaged plastic waste per capita than lower-income groups.
- Effective environmental infrastructure is critical for waste reduction in low-income settings.

## 📌 Future Work

- Integrating machine learning models for prediction
- Agent-based simulation for policy modeling
- Geo-visual analysis of pollution hotspots
